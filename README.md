# April's Lil Pugs

A 100% under construction project I am developing tailored to the Clients needs and desires. 

Currently under rework for properly managing the data within our local servers

Modern, responsive website built to showcase and manage a dog breeding business.

## Technologies
- Vite React
- Python w/Flask

## Features ( or soon to be )
- Real-time database updates
- Fallback data ( this is self hosted so we're not expecting blazing speeds )
- Waitlist for users to join and view
- Media Post w/ user comments
- User Reviews
